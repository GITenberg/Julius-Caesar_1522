<h3><b>ACT I</b></h3>

<h4><b>SCENE I. Rome. A street.</b></h4>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Flavius, Marullus</span> and
a throng of <span class="charname">Citizens</span>.</p>

<p>FLAVIUS.<br/>
Hence! home, you idle creatures, get you home.<br/>
Is this a holiday? What, know you not,<br/>
Being mechanical, you ought not walk<br/>
Upon a labouring day without the sign<br/>
Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?
</p>

<p>CARPENTER.<br/>
Why, sir, a carpenter.
</p>

<p>MARULLUS.<br/>
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?<br/>
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?<br/>
You, sir, what trade are you?
</p>

<p>COBBLER.<br/>
Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but, as you would say, a
cobbler.
</p>

<p>MARULLUS.<br/>
But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.
</p>

<p>COBBLER.<br/>
A trade, sir, that I hope I may use with a safe conscience, which is indeed,
sir, a mender of bad soles.
</p>

<p>MARULLUS.<br/>
What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what trade?
</p>

<p>COBBLER.<br/>
Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me; yet, if you be out, sir, I can
mend you.
</p>

<p>MARULLUS.<br/>
What mean&rsquo;st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy fellow!
</p>

<p>COBBLER.<br/>
Why, sir, cobble you.
</p>

<p>FLAVIUS.<br/>
Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
</p>

<p>COBBLER.<br/>
Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl; I meddle with no
tradesman&rsquo;s matters, nor women&rsquo;s matters, but withal I am
indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes: when they are in great danger, I recover
them. As proper men as ever trod upon neat&rsquo;s leather have gone upon my
handiwork.
</p>

<p>FLAVIUS.<br/>
But wherefore art not in thy shop today?<br/>
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
</p>

<p>COBBLER.<br/>
Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself into more work. But indeed,
sir, we make holiday to see Caesar, and to rejoice in his triumph.
</p>

<p>MARULLUS.<br/>
Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?<br/>
What tributaries follow him to Rome,<br/>
To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?<br/>
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!<br/>
O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,<br/>
Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft<br/>
Have you climb&rsquo;d up to walls and battlements,<br/>
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,<br/>
Your infants in your arms, and there have sat<br/>
The livelong day with patient expectation,<br/>
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.<br/>
And when you saw his chariot but appear,<br/>
Have you not made an universal shout,<br/>
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks<br/>
To hear the replication of your sounds<br/>
Made in her concave shores?<br/>
And do you now put on your best attire?<br/>
And do you now cull out a holiday?<br/>
And do you now strew flowers in his way,<br/>
That comes in triumph over Pompey&rsquo;s blood?<br/>
Be gone!<br/>
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,<br/>
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague<br/>
That needs must light on this ingratitude.
</p>

<p>FLAVIUS.<br/>
Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault<br/>
Assemble all the poor men of your sort,<br/>
Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears<br/>
Into the channel, till the lowest stream<br/>
Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exeunt <span class="charname">Citizens</span>.</i>]</p>

<p>See whether their basest metal be not mov&rsquo;d;<br/>
They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.<br/>
Go you down that way towards the Capitol;<br/>
This way will I. Disrobe the images,<br/>
If you do find them deck&rsquo;d with ceremonies.
</p>

<p>MARULLUS.<br/>
May we do so?<br/>
You know it is the feast of Lupercal.
</p>

<p>FLAVIUS.<br/>
It is no matter; let no images<br/>
Be hung with Caesar&rsquo;s trophies. I&rsquo;ll about<br/>
And drive away the vulgar from the streets;<br/>
So do you too, where you perceive them thick.<br/>
These growing feathers pluck&rsquo;d from Caesar&rsquo;s wing<br/>
Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,<br/>
Who else would soar above the view of men,<br/>
And keep us all in servile fearfulness.

<p>CALPHURNIA.<br/>
Here, my lord.
</p>

<p>CAESAR.<br/>
Stand you directly in Antonius&rsquo; way,<br/>
When he doth run his course. Antonius.
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
Caesar, my lord?
</p>

<p>CAESAR.<br/>
Forget not in your speed, Antonius,<br/>
To touch Calphurnia; for our elders say,<br/>
The barren, touched in this holy chase,<br/>
Shake off their sterile curse.
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
I shall remember.<br/>
When Caesar says &ldquo;Do this,&rdquo; it is perform&rsquo;d.
</p>

<p>CAESAR.<br/>
Set on; and leave no ceremony out.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Music.</i>]</p>

</p>

<p>CAESAR.<br/>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
Bid every noise be still; peace yet again!
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Music ceases.</i>]</p>

<p>CAESAR.<br/>
Who is it in the press that calls on me?<br/>
I hear a tongue shriller than all the music,<br/>
Cry &ldquo;Caesar&rdquo;! Speak. Caesar is turn&rsquo;d to hear.
</p>

<p>SOOTHSAYER.<br/>
Beware the Ides of March.
</p>

<p>CAESAR.<br/>
What man is that?
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
A soothsayer bids you beware the Ides of March.
</p>

<p>CAESAR.<br/>
Set him before me; let me see his face.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.
</p>

<p>CAESAR.<br/>
What say&rsquo;st thou to me now? Speak once again.
</p>

<p>SOOTHSAYER.<br/>
Beware the Ides of March.
</p>

<p>CAESAR.<br/>
He is a dreamer; let us leave him. Pass.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Sennet. Exeunt all but <span class="charname">Brutus</span>
and <span class="charname">Cassius</span>.</i>]</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Will you go see the order of the course?
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Not I.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
I pray you, do.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
I am not gamesome: I do lack some part<br/>
Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.<br/>
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;<br/>
I&rsquo;ll leave you.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Brutus, I do observe you now of late:<br/>
I have not from your eyes that gentleness<br/>
And show of love as I was wont to have.<br/>
You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand<br/>
Over your friend that loves you.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Cassius,<br/>
Be not deceived: if I have veil&rsquo;d my look,<br/>
I turn the trouble of my countenance<br/>
Merely upon myself. Vexed I am<br/>
Of late with passions of some difference,<br/>
Conceptions only proper to myself,<br/>
Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;<br/>
But let not therefore my good friends be grieved<br/>
(Among which number, Cassius, be you one)<br/>
Nor construe any further my neglect,<br/>
Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,<br/>
Forgets the shows of love to other men.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;<br/>
By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried<br/>
Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.<br/>
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself<br/>
But by reflection, by some other thing.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis just:<br/>
And it is very much lamented, Brutus,<br/>
That you have no such mirrors as will turn<br/>
Your hidden worthiness into your eye,<br/>
That you might see your shadow. I have heard<br/>
Where many of the best respect in Rome,<br/>
(Except immortal Caesar) speaking of Brutus,<br/>
And groaning underneath this age&rsquo;s yoke,<br/>
Have wish&rsquo;d that noble Brutus had his eyes.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,<br/>
That you would have me seek into myself<br/>
For that which is not in me?
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear;<br/>
And since you know you cannot see yourself<br/>
So well as by reflection, I, your glass,<br/>
Will modestly discover to yourself<br/>
That of yourself which you yet know not of.<br/>
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:<br/>
Were I a common laugher, or did use<br/>
To stale with ordinary oaths my love<br/>
To every new protester; if you know<br/>
That I do fawn on men, and hug them hard,<br/>
And after scandal them; or if you know<br/>
That I profess myself in banqueting,<br/>
To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Flourish and shout.</i>]</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
What means this shouting? I do fear the people<br/>
Choose Caesar for their king.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Ay, do you fear it?<br/>
Then must I think you would not have it so.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well,<br/>
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?<br/>
What is it that you would impart to me?<br/>
If it be aught toward the general good,<br/>
Set honour in one eye and death i&rsquo; the other,<br/>
And I will look on both indifferently;<br/>
For let the gods so speed me as I love<br/>
The name of honour more than I fear death.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,<br/>
As well as I do know your outward favour.<br/>
Well, honour is the subject of my story.<br/>
I cannot tell what you and other men<br/>
Think of this life; but, for my single self,<br/>
I had as lief not be as live to be<br/>
In awe of such a thing as I myself.<br/>
I was born free as Caesar; so were you;<br/>
We both have fed as well, and we can both<br/>
Endure the winter&rsquo;s cold as well as he:<br/>
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,<br/>
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,<br/>
Caesar said to me, &ldquo;Dar&rsquo;st thou, Cassius, now<br/>
Leap in with me into this angry flood,<br/>
And swim to yonder point?&rdquo; Upon the word,<br/>
Accoutred as I was, I plunged in,<br/>
And bade him follow: so indeed he did.<br/>
The torrent roar&rsquo;d, and we did buffet it<br/>
With lusty sinews, throwing it aside<br/>
And stemming it with hearts of controversy.<br/>
But ere we could arrive the point propos&rsquo;d,<br/>
Caesar cried, &ldquo;Help me, Cassius, or I sink!&rdquo;<br/>
I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,<br/>
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder<br/>
The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber<br/>
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man<br/>
Is now become a god; and Cassius is<br/>
A wretched creature, and must bend his body,<br/>
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.<br/>
He had a fever when he was in Spain,<br/>
And when the fit was on him I did mark<br/>
How he did shake: &rsquo;tis true, this god did shake:<br/>
His coward lips did from their colour fly,<br/>
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world<br/>
Did lose his lustre. I did hear him groan:<br/>
Ay, and that tongue of his, that bade the Romans<br/>
Mark him, and write his speeches in their books,<br/>
Alas, it cried, &ldquo;Give me some drink, Titinius,&rdquo;<br/>
As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me,<br/>
A man of such a feeble temper should<br/>
So get the start of the majestic world,<br/>
And bear the palm alone.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Shout. Flourish.</i>]</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Another general shout?<br/>
I do believe that these applauses are<br/>
For some new honours that are heap&rsquo;d on Caesar.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world<br/>
Like a Colossus, and we petty men<br/>
Walk under his huge legs, and peep about<br/>
To find ourselves dishonourable graves.<br/>
Men at some time are masters of their fates:<br/>
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,<br/>
But in ourselves, that we are underlings.<br/>
&ldquo;Brutus&rdquo; and &ldquo;Caesar&rdquo;: what should be in that &ldquo;Caesar&rdquo;?<br/>
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?<br/>
Write them together, yours is as fair a name;<br/>
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;<br/>
Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with &rsquo;em,<br/>
&ldquo;Brutus&rdquo; will start a spirit as soon as &ldquo;Caesar.&rdquo;<br/>
Now in the names of all the gods at once,<br/>
Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,<br/>
That he is grown so great? Age, thou art sham&rsquo;d!<br/>
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!<br/>
When went there by an age since the great flood,<br/>
But it was fam&rsquo;d with more than with one man?<br/>
When could they say, till now, that talk&rsquo;d of Rome,<br/>
That her wide walls encompass&rsquo;d but one man?<br/>
Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,<br/>
When there is in it but one only man.<br/>
O, you and I have heard our fathers say,<br/>
There was a Brutus once that would have brook&rsquo;d<br/>
Th&rsquo; eternal devil to keep his state in Rome,<br/>
As easily as a king!
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;<br/>
What you would work me to, I have some aim:<br/>
How I have thought of this, and of these times,<br/>
I shall recount hereafter. For this present,<br/>
I would not, so with love I might entreat you,<br/>
Be any further mov&rsquo;d. What you have said,<br/>
I will consider; what you have to say<br/>
I will with patience hear; and find a time<br/>
Both meet to hear and answer such high things.<br/>
Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:<br/>
Brutus had rather be a villager<br/>
Than to repute himself a son of Rome<br/>
Under these hard conditions as this time<br/>
Is like to lay upon us.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
I am glad that my weak words<br/>
Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Caesar</span> and his Train.</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
The games are done, and Caesar is returning.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,<br/>
And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you<br/>
What hath proceeded worthy note today.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,<br/>
The angry spot doth glow on Caesar&rsquo;s brow,<br/>
And all the rest look like a chidden train:<br/>
Calphurnia&rsquo;s cheek is pale; and Cicero<br/>
Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes<br/>
As we have seen him in the Capitol,<br/>
Being cross&rsquo;d in conference by some senators.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Casca will tell us what the matter is.
</p>

<p>CAESAR.<br/>
Antonius.
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
Caesar?
</p>

<p>CAESAR.<br/>
Let me have men about me that are fat,<br/>
Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights:<br/>
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;<br/>
He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
Fear him not, Caesar; he&rsquo;s not dangerous;<br/>
He is a noble Roman and well given.
</p>

<p>CAESAR.<br/>
Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:<br/>
Yet if my name were liable to fear,<br/>
I do not know the man I should avoid<br/>
So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,<br/>
He is a great observer, and he looks<br/>
Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,<br/>
As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music.<br/>
Seldom he smiles; and smiles in such a sort<br/>
As if he mock&rsquo;d himself and scorn&rsquo;d his spirit<br/>
That could be mov&rsquo;d to smile at anything.<br/>
Such men as he be never at heart&rsquo;s ease<br/>
Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,<br/>
And therefore are they very dangerous.<br/>
I rather tell thee what is to be fear&rsquo;d<br/>
Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.<br/>
Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,<br/>
And tell me truly what thou think&rsquo;st of him.

<p>CASCA.<br/>
You pull&rsquo;d me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanc&rsquo;d today,<br/>
That Caesar looks so sad.
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
Why, you were with him, were you not?
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
I should not then ask Casca what had chanc&rsquo;d.
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
Why, there was a crown offer&rsquo;d him; and being offer&rsquo;d him, he put
it by with the back of his hand, thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
What was the second noise for?
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
Why, for that too.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
Why, for that too.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Was the crown offer&rsquo;d him thrice?
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
Ay, marry, was&rsquo;t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other;
and at every putting-by mine honest neighbours shouted.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Who offer&rsquo;d him the crown?
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
Why, Antony.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
I can as well be hang&rsquo;d, as tell the manner of it: it was mere foolery; I
did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown; yet &rsquo;twas not a
crown neither, &rsquo;twas one of these coronets; and, as I told you, he put it
by once: but, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he
offered it to him again: then he put it by again: but, to my thinking, he was
very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time; he
put it the third time by; and still, as he refus&rsquo;d it, the rabblement
hooted, and clapp&rsquo;d their chopt hands, and threw up their sweaty
night-caps, and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar
refus&rsquo;d the crown, that it had, almost, choked Caesar, for he swooned,
and fell down at it. And for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of
opening my lips and receiving the bad air.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
But, soft! I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon?
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
He fell down in the market-place, and foam&rsquo;d at mouth, and was
speechless.</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis very like: he hath the falling-sickness.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
No, Caesar hath it not; but you, and I,<br/>
And honest Casca, we have the falling-sickness.
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
I know not what you mean by that; but I am sure Caesar fell down. If the
tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and
displeased them, as they use to do the players in the theatre, I am no true man.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
What said he when he came unto himself?
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he
refused the crown, he pluck&rsquo;d me ope his doublet, and offer&rsquo;d them
his throat to cut. And I had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have
taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so he
fell. When he came to himself again, he said, if he had done or said anything
amiss, he desir&rsquo;d their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or
four wenches where I stood cried, &ldquo;Alas, good soul!&rdquo; and forgave
him with all their hearts. But there&rsquo;s no heed to be taken of them: if
Caesar had stabb&rsquo;d their mothers, they would have done no less.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
And, after that, he came thus sad away?
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
Ay.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Did Cicero say anything?
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
Ay, he spoke Greek.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
To what effect?
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
Nay, and I tell you that, I&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er look you i&rsquo; the face
again. But those that understood him smil&rsquo;d at one another and shook their
heads; but for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more news
too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs off Caesar&rsquo;s images, are
put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember
it.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
No, I am promis&rsquo;d forth.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Will you dine with me tomorrow?
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the eating.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Good. I will expect you.
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
Do so; farewell both.

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!<br/>
He was quick mettle when he went to school.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
So is he now in execution<br/>
Of any bold or noble enterprise,<br/>
However he puts on this tardy form.<br/>
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,<br/>
Which gives men stomach to digest his words<br/>
With better appetite.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
And so it is. For this time I will leave you:<br/>
Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,<br/>
I will come home to you; or, if you will,<br/>
Come home to me, and I will wait for you.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
I will do so: till then, think of the world.

<p>Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet I see,<br/>
Thy honourable metal may be wrought<br/>
From that it is dispos&rsquo;d: therefore &rsquo;tis meet<br/>
That noble minds keep ever with their likes;<br/>
For who so firm that cannot be seduc&rsquo;d?<br/>
Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.<br/>
If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius,<br/>
He should not humour me. I will this night,<br/>
In several hands, in at his windows throw,<br/>
As if they came from several citizens,<br/>
Writings, all tending to the great opinion<br/>
That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely<br/>
Caesar&rsquo;s ambition shall be glanced at.<br/>
And after this, let Caesar seat him sure,<br/>
For we will shake him, or worse days endure.

<h4><b>SCENE III. The same. A street.</b></h4>

<p class="scenedesc"> Thunder and lightning. Enter, from opposite sides,
<span class="charname">Casca</span> with his sword drawn, and
<span class="charname">Cicero</span>.</p>

<p>CICERO.<br/>
Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?<br/>
Why are you breathless, and why stare you so?
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth<br/>
Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,<br/>
I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds<br/>
Have riv&rsquo;d the knotty oaks; and I have seen<br/>
Th&rsquo; ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,<br/>
To be exalted with the threatening clouds:<br/>
But never till tonight, never till now,<br/>
Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.<br/>
Either there is a civil strife in heaven,<br/>
Or else the world too saucy with the gods,<br/>
Incenses them to send destruction.
</p>

<p>CICERO.<br/>
Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
A common slave, you&rsquo;d know him well by sight,<br/>
Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn<br/>
Like twenty torches join&rsquo;d, and yet his hand,<br/>
Not sensible of fire remain&rsquo;d unscorch&rsquo;d.<br/>
Besides, I ha&rsquo; not since put up my sword,<br/>
Against the Capitol I met a lion,<br/>
Who glared upon me, and went surly by,<br/>
Without annoying me. And there were drawn<br/>
Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,<br/>
Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw<br/>
Men, all in fire, walk up and down the streets.<br/>
And yesterday the bird of night did sit,<br/>
Even at noonday upon the marketplace,<br/>
Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies<br/>
Do so conjointly meet, let not men say,<br/>
&ldquo;These are their reasons; they are natural&rdquo;;<br/>
For I believe, they are portentous things<br/>
Unto the climate that they point upon.
</p>

<p>CICERO.<br/>
Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.<br/>
But men may construe things after their fashion,<br/>
Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.<br/>
Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
He doth, for he did bid Antonius<br/>
Send word to you he would be there tomorrow.
</p>

<p>CICERO.<br/>
Goodnight then, Casca: this disturbed sky<br/>
Is not to walk in.
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
Farewell, Cicero.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Who&rsquo;s there?
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
A Roman.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Casca, by your voice.
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
A very pleasing night to honest men.
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Those that have known the earth so full of faults.<br/>
For my part, I have walk&rsquo;d about the streets,<br/>
Submitting me unto the perilous night;<br/>
And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,<br/>
Have bar&rsquo;d my bosom to the thunder-stone;<br/>
And when the cross blue lightning seem&rsquo;d to open<br/>
The breast of heaven, I did present myself<br/>
Even in the aim and very flash of it.
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
But wherefore did you so much tempt the Heavens?<br/>
It is the part of men to fear and tremble,<br/>
When the most mighty gods by tokens send<br/>
Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
You are dull, Casca; and those sparks of life<br/>
That should be in a Roman you do want,<br/>
Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze,<br/>
And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,<br/>
To see the strange impatience of the Heavens:<br/>
But if you would consider the true cause<br/>
Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,<br/>
Why birds and beasts, from quality and kind;<br/>
Why old men, fools, and children calculate,<br/>
Why all these things change from their ordinance,<br/>
Their natures, and pre-formed faculties,<br/>
To monstrous quality; why, you shall find<br/>
That Heaven hath infus&rsquo;d them with these spirits,<br/>
To make them instruments of fear and warning<br/>
Unto some monstrous state.<br/>
Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man<br/>
Most like this dreadful night,<br/>
That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars,<br/>
As doth the lion in the Capitol;<br/>
A man no mightier than thyself, or me,<br/>
In personal action; yet prodigious grown,<br/>
And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Let it be who it is: for Romans now<br/>
Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;<br/>
But, woe the while! our fathers&rsquo; minds are dead,<br/>
And we are govern&rsquo;d with our mothers&rsquo; spirits;<br/>
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow<br/>
Mean to establish Caesar as a king;<br/>
And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,<br/>
In every place, save here in Italy.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
I know where I will wear this dagger then;<br/>
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:<br/>
Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;<br/>
Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.<br/>
Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,<br/>
Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,<br/>
Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;<br/>
But life, being weary of these worldly bars,<br/>
Never lacks power to dismiss itself.<br/>
If I know this, know all the world besides,<br/>
That part of tyranny that I do bear<br/>
I can shake off at pleasure.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Thunder still.</i>]</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
So can I:<br/>
So every bondman in his own hand bears<br/>
The power to cancel his captivity.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?<br/>
Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,<br/>
But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:<br/>
He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.<br/>
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire<br/>
Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,<br/>
What rubbish, and what offal, when it serves<br/>
For the base matter to illuminate<br/>
So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,<br/>
Where hast thou led me? I, perhaps, speak this<br/>
Before a willing bondman: then I know<br/>
My answer must be made; but I am arm&rsquo;d,<br/>
And dangers are to me indifferent.
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
You speak to Casca, and to such a man<br/>
That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:<br/>
Be factious for redress of all these griefs,<br/>
And I will set this foot of mine as far<br/>
As who goes farthest.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
There&rsquo;s a bargain made.<br/>
Now know you, Casca, I have mov&rsquo;d already<br/>
Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans<br/>
To undergo with me an enterprise<br/>
Of honourable-dangerous consequence;<br/>
And I do know by this, they stay for me<br/>
In Pompey&rsquo;s Porch: for now, this fearful night,<br/>
There is no stir or walking in the streets;<br/>
And the complexion of the element<br/>
In favour&rsquo;s like the work we have in hand,<br/>
Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.

He is a friend. Cinna, where haste you so?
</p>

<p>CINNA.<br/>
To find out you. Who&rsquo;s that? Metellus Cimber?
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
No, it is Casca, one incorporate<br/>
To our attempts. Am I not stay&rsquo;d for, Cinna?
</p>

<p>CINNA.<br/>
I am glad on&rsquo;t. What a fearful night is this!<br/>
There&rsquo;s two or three of us have seen strange sights.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Am I not stay&rsquo;d for? tell me.
</p>

<p>CINNA.<br/>
Yes, you are. O Cassius, if you could<br/>
But win the noble Brutus to our party&mdash;
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,<br/>
And look you lay it in the praetor&rsquo;s chair,<br/>
Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this<br/>
In at his window; set this up with wax<br/>
Upon old Brutus&rsquo; statue: all this done,<br/>
Repair to Pompey&rsquo;s Porch, where you shall find us.<br/>
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
</p>

<p>CINNA.<br/>
All but Metellus Cimber, and he&rsquo;s gone<br/>
To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,<br/>
And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
That done, repair to Pompey&rsquo;s theatre.
</p>

Upon the next encounter, yields him ours.

Weighing the youthful season of the year.<br/>
Some two months hence, up higher toward the North<br/>
He first presents his fire; and the high East<br/>
Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Give me your hands all over, one by one.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
And let us swear our resolution.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
No, not an oath. If not the face of men,<br/>
The sufferance of our souls, the time&rsquo;s abuse&mdash;<br/>
If these be motives weak, break off betimes,<br/>
And every man hence to his idle bed.<br/>
So let high-sighted tyranny range on,<br/>
Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,<br/>
As I am sure they do, bear fire enough<br/>
To kindle cowards, and to steel with valour<br/>
The melting spirits of women; then, countrymen,<br/>
What need we any spur but our own cause<br/>
To prick us to redress? what other bond<br/>
Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,<br/>
And will not palter? and what other oath<br/>
Than honesty to honesty engag&rsquo;d,<br/>
That this shall be, or we will fall for it?<br/>
Swear priests and cowards, and men cautelous,<br/>
Old feeble carrions, and such suffering souls<br/>
That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear<br/>
Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain<br/>
The even virtue of our enterprise,<br/>
Nor th&rsquo; insuppressive mettle of our spirits,<br/>
To think that or our cause or our performance<br/>
Did need an oath; when every drop of blood<br/>
That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,<br/>
Is guilty of a several bastardy,<br/>
If he do break the smallest particle<br/>
Of any promise that hath pass&rsquo;d from him.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?<br/>
I think he will stand very strong with us.
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
Let us not leave him out.
</p>

<p>CINNA.<br/>
No, by no means.
</p>

<p>METELLUS.<br/>
O, let us have him, for his silver hairs<br/>
Will purchase us a good opinion,<br/>
And buy men&rsquo;s voices to commend our deeds.<br/>
It shall be said, his judgment rul&rsquo;d our hands;<br/>
Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,<br/>
But all be buried in his gravity.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
O, name him not; let us not break with him;<br/>
For he will never follow anything<br/>
That other men begin.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Then leave him out.
</p>

<p>CASCA.<br/>
Indeed, he is not fit.
</p>

<p>DECIUS.<br/>
Shall no man else be touch&rsquo;d but only Caesar?
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Decius, well urg&rsquo;d. I think it is not meet,<br/>
Mark Antony, so well belov&rsquo;d of Caesar,<br/>
Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him<br/>
A shrewd contriver; and you know, his means,<br/>
If he improve them, may well stretch so far<br/>
As to annoy us all; which to prevent,<br/>
Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,<br/>
To cut the head off, and then hack the limbs,<br/>
Like wrath in death, and envy afterwards;<br/>
For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.<br/>
Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.<br/>
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,<br/>
And in the spirit of men there is no blood.<br/>
O, that we then could come by Caesar&rsquo;s spirit,<br/>
And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,<br/>
Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,<br/>
Let&rsquo;s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;<br/>
Let&rsquo;s carve him as a dish fit for the gods,<br/>
Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.<br/>
And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,<br/>
Stir up their servants to an act of rage,<br/>
And after seem to chide &rsquo;em. This shall mark<br/>
Our purpose necessary, and not envious;<br/>
Which so appearing to the common eyes,<br/>
We shall be call&rsquo;d purgers, not murderers.<br/>
And for Mark Antony, think not of him;<br/>
For he can do no more than Caesar&rsquo;s arm<br/>
When Caesar&rsquo;s head is off.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Yet I fear him;<br/>
For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar&mdash;
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:<br/>
If he love Caesar, all that he can do<br/>
Is to himself; take thought and die for Caesar.<br/>
And that were much he should; for he is given<br/>
To sports, to wildness, and much company.
</p>

<p>TREBONIUS.<br/>
There is no fear in him; let him not die;<br/>
For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Clock strikes.</i>]</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>

</p>

<p>TREBONIUS.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis time to part.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
But it is doubtful yet<br/>
Whether Caesar will come forth today or no;<br/>
For he is superstitious grown of late,<br/>
Quite from the main opinion he held once<br/>
Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.<br/>
It may be these apparent prodigies,<br/>
The unaccustom&rsquo;d terror of this night,<br/>
And the persuasion of his augurers,<br/>
May hold him from the Capitol today.
</p>

<p>DECIUS.<br/>
Never fear that: if he be so resolved,<br/>
I can o&rsquo;ersway him, for he loves to hear<br/>
That unicorns may be betray&rsquo;d with trees,<br/>
And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,<br/>
Lions with toils, and men with flatterers.<br/>
But when I tell him he hates flatterers,<br/>
He says he does, being then most flattered.<br/>
Let me work;<br/>
For I can give his humour the true bent,<br/>
And I will bring him to the Capitol.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?
</p>

<p>CINNA.<br/>
Be that the uttermost; and fail not then.
</p>

<p>METELLUS.<br/>
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,<br/>
Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey;<br/>
I wonder none of you have thought of him.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Now, good Metellus, go along by him:<br/>
He loves me well, and I have given him reason;<br/>
Send him but hither, and I&rsquo;ll fashion him.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
The morning comes upon&rsquo;s. We&rsquo;ll leave you, Brutus.<br/>
And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember<br/>
What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;<br/>
Let not our looks put on our purposes,<br/>
But bear it as our Roman actors do,<br/>
With untired spirits and formal constancy.<br/>
And so, good morrow to you everyone.

Nor for yours neither. Y&rsquo; have ungently, Brutus,<br/>
Stole from my bed; and yesternight at supper,<br/>
You suddenly arose, and walk&rsquo;d about,<br/>
Musing and sighing, with your arms across;<br/>
And when I ask&rsquo;d you what the matter was,<br/>
You star&rsquo;d upon me with ungentle looks.<br/>
I urg&rsquo;d you further; then you scratch&rsquo;d your head,<br/>
And too impatiently stamp&rsquo;d with your foot;<br/>
Yet I insisted, yet you answer&rsquo;d not,<br/>
But with an angry wafture of your hand<br/>
Gave sign for me to leave you. So I did,<br/>
Fearing to strengthen that impatience<br/>
Which seem&rsquo;d too much enkindled; and withal<br/>
Hoping it was but an effect of humour,<br/>
Which sometime hath his hour with every man.<br/>
It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep;<br/>
And could it work so much upon your shape<br/>
As it hath much prevail&rsquo;d on your condition,<br/>
I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,<br/>
Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
I am not well in health, and that is all.
</p>

Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,<br/>
He would embrace the means to come by it.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
</p>

<p>PORTIA.<br/>
Is Brutus sick, and is it physical<br/>
To walk unbraced and suck up the humours<br/>
Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,<br/>
And will he steal out of his wholesome bed<br/>
To dare the vile contagion of the night,<br/>
And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air<br/>
To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;<br/>
You have some sick offence within your mind,<br/>
Which, by the right and virtue of my place,<br/>
I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,<br/>
I charm you, by my once commended beauty,<br/>
By all your vows of love, and that great vow<br/>
Which did incorporate and make us one,<br/>
That you unfold to me, your self, your half,<br/>
Why you are heavy, and what men tonight<br/>
Have had resort to you; for here have been<br/>
Some six or seven, who did hide their faces<br/>
Even from darkness.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Kneel not, gentle Portia.
</p>

<p>PORTIA.<br/>
I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.<br/>
Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,<br/>
Is it excepted I should know no secrets<br/>
That appertain to you? Am I your self<br/>
But, as it were, in sort or limitation,<br/>
To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,<br/>
And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs<br/>
Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,<br/>
Portia is Brutus&rsquo; harlot, not his wife.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
You are my true and honourable wife,<br/>
As dear to me as are the ruddy drops<br/>
That visit my sad heart.
</p>

Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,<br/>
Yet now they fright me. There is one within,<br/>
Besides the things that we have heard and seen,<br/>
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.<br/>
A lioness hath whelped in the streets,<br/>
And graves have yawn&rsquo;d, and yielded up their dead;<br/>
Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds<br/>
In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,<br/>
Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;<br/>
The noise of battle hurtled in the air,<br/>
Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,<br/>
And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.<br/>
O Caesar, these things are beyond all use,<br/>
And I do fear them!
</p>

Did run pure blood; and many lusty Romans<br/>
Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it.<br/>
And these does she apply for warnings and portents<br/>
And evils imminent; and on her knee<br/>
Hath begg&rsquo;d that I will stay at home today.

<p>DECIUS.<br/>
This dream is all amiss interpreted:<br/>
It was a vision fair and fortunate.<br/>
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,<br/>
In which so many smiling Romans bath&rsquo;d,<br/>
Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck<br/>
Reviving blood, and that great men shall press<br/>
For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.<br/>

I have, when you have heard what I can say;<br/>

To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.<br/>
If you shall send them word you will not come,<br/>
Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock<br/>
Apt to be render&rsquo;d, for someone to say,<br/>
&ldquo;Break up the Senate till another time,<br/>
When Caesar&rsquo;s wife shall meet with better dreams.&rdquo;<br/>
If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper<br/>
&ldquo;Lo, Caesar is afraid&rdquo;?<br/>

Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat<br/>
An humble heart.

<p>CAESAR.<br/>
I must prevent thee, Cimber.<br/>
These couchings and these lowly courtesies<br/>
Might fire the blood of ordinary men,<br/>
And turn pre-ordinance and first decree<br/>
Into the law of children. Be not fond,<br/>
To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood<br/>
That will be thaw&rsquo;d from the true quality<br/>
With that which melteth fools; I mean sweet words,<br/>
Low-crooked curtsies, and base spaniel fawning.<br/>
Thy brother by decree is banished:<br/>
If thou dost bend, and pray, and fawn for him,<br/>
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.<br/>
Know, Caesar dost not wrong, nor without cause<br/>
Will he be satisfied.
</p>

<p>METELLUS.<br/>
Is there no voice more worthy than my own,<br/>
To sound more sweetly in great Caesar&rsquo;s ear<br/>
For the repealing of my banish&rsquo;d brother?
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;<br/>
Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may<br/>
Have an immediate freedom of repeal.
</p>

<p>CAESAR.<br/>
What, Brutus?
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:<br/>
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,<br/>
To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.
</p>

<p>CAESAR.<br/>
I could be well mov&rsquo;d, if I were as you;<br/>
If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:<br/>
But I am constant as the northern star,<br/>
Of whose true-fix&rsquo;d and resting quality<br/>
There is no fellow in the firmament.<br/>
The skies are painted with unnumber&rsquo;d sparks,<br/>
They are all fire, and every one doth shine;<br/>
But there&rsquo;s but one in all doth hold his place.<br/>
So in the world; &rsquo;tis furnish&rsquo;d well with men,<br/>
And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;<br/>
Yet in the number I do know but one<br/>
That unassailable holds on his rank,<br/>
Unshak&rsquo;d of motion: and that I am he,<br/>
Let me a little show it, even in this,<br/>
That I was constant Cimber should be banish&rsquo;d,<br/>

Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,<br/>

Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:<br/>
If I myself, there is no hour so fit<br/>
As Caesar&rsquo;s death&rsquo;s hour; nor no instrument<br/>
Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich<br/>
With the most noble blood of all this world.<br/>
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,<br/>
Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,<br/>
Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years,<br/>
I shall not find myself so apt to die.<br/>
No place will please me so, no means of death,<br/>
As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,<br/>
The choice and master spirits of this age.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
O Antony, beg not your death of us.<br/>
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,<br/>
As by our hands and this our present act<br/>
You see we do; yet see you but our hands<br/>
And this the bleeding business they have done.<br/>
Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;<br/>
And pity to the general wrong of Rome&mdash;<br/>
As fire drives out fire, so pity pity&mdash;<br/>
Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,<br/>
To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony;<br/>
Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts<br/>
Of brothers&rsquo; temper, do receive you in<br/>
With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Your voice shall be as strong as any man&rsquo;s<br/>
In the disposing of new dignities.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Only be patient till we have appeas&rsquo;d<br/>
The multitude, beside themselves with fear,<br/>
And then we will deliver you the cause<br/>
Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,<br/>
Have thus proceeded.
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
I doubt not of your wisdom.<br/>
Let each man render me his bloody hand.<br/>
First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;<br/>
Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.<br/>
Now, Decius Brutus, yours; now yours, Metellus;<br/>
Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;<br/>
Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.<br/>
Gentlemen all&mdash;alas, what shall I say?<br/>
My credit now stands on such slippery ground,<br/>
That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,<br/>
Either a coward or a flatterer.<br/>
That I did love thee, Caesar, O, &rsquo;tis true:<br/>
If then thy spirit look upon us now,<br/>
Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,<br/>
To see thy Antony making his peace,<br/>
Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,<br/>
Most noble, in the presence of thy corse?<br/>
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,<br/>
Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,<br/>
It would become me better than to close<br/>
In terms of friendship with thine enemies.<br/>
Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay&rsquo;d, brave hart;<br/>
Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,<br/>
Sign&rsquo;d in thy spoil, and crimson&rsquo;d in thy lethe.<br/>
O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;<br/>
And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee.<br/>
How like a deer strucken by many princes,<br/>
Dost thou here lie!

The enemies of Caesar shall say this;<br/>
Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
I blame you not for praising Caesar so;<br/>
But what compact mean you to have with us?<br/>
Will you be prick&rsquo;d in number of our friends,<br/>
Or shall we on, and not depend on you?
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
Therefore I took your hands; but was indeed<br/>
Sway&rsquo;d from the point, by looking down on Caesar.<br/>
Friends am I with you all, and love you all,<br/>
Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons<br/>
Why, and wherein, Caesar was dangerous.

He speaks by leave and by permission;<br/>
And that we are contented Caesar shall<br/>

It shall advantage more than do us wrong.

You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,<br/>
But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,<br/>

Else shall you not have any hand at all<br/>
About his funeral. And you shall speak<br/>

may believe. Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses, that you may the
better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of
Caesar&rsquo;s, to him I say that Brutus&rsquo; love to Caesar was no less than
his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my
answer: Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you
rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to
live all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate, I
rejoice at it; as he was valiant, I honour him; but, as he was ambitious, I
slew him. There is tears, for his love; joy for his fortune; honour for his
valour; and death, for his ambition. Who is here so base, that would be a
bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so rude, that
would not be a Roman? If any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so
vile, that will not love his country? If any, speak; for him have I offended. I
pause for a reply.

which he suffered death.

death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a place in the commonwealth; as
which of you shall not? With this I depart, that, as I slew my best lover for
the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself, when it shall please my
country to need my death.
</p>

<p>CITIZENS.<br/>
Live, Brutus! live, live!
</p>

<p>FIRST CITIZEN.<br/>
Bring him with triumph home unto his house.

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
My countrymen,&mdash;

<p>SECOND CITIZEN.<br/>
Peace! Silence! Brutus speaks.
</p>

<p>FIRST CITIZEN.<br/>
Peace, ho!
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Good countrymen, let me depart alone,<br/>
And, for my sake, stay here with Antony.<br/>
Do grace to Caesar&rsquo;s corpse, and grace his speech<br/>
Tending to Caesar&rsquo;s glories, which Mark Antony,<br/>
By our permission, is allow&rsquo;d to make.<br/>
I do entreat you, not a man depart,<br/>
Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.

</p>

</p>

<p>THIRD CITIZEN.<br/>

He finds himself beholding to us all.
</p>

<p>FOURTH CITIZEN.<br/>
&rsquo;Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here!
</p>

<p>FIRST CITIZEN.<br/>
This Caesar was a tyrant.
</p>

<p>THIRD CITIZEN.<br/>
Nay, that&rsquo;s certain.<br/>
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
</p>

<p>SECOND CITIZEN.<br/>
Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
You gentle Romans,&mdash;
</p>

<p>CITIZENS.<br/>
Peace, ho! let us hear him.
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;<br/>
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.<br/>
The evil that men do lives after them,<br/>
The good is oft interred with their bones;<br/>
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus<br/>
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious.<br/>
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,<br/>
And grievously hath Caesar answer&rsquo;d it.<br/>
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,<br/>
For Brutus is an honourable man,<br/>
So are they all, all honourable men,<br/>
Come I to speak in Caesar&rsquo;s funeral.<br/>
He was my friend, faithful and just to me;<br/>
But Brutus says he was ambitious,<br/>
And Brutus is an honourable man.<br/>
He hath brought many captives home to Rome,<br/>
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:<br/>
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?<br/>
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;<br/>
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:<br/>
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<br/>
And Brutus is an honourable man.<br/>
You all did see that on the Lupercal<br/>
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,<br/>
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?<br/>
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<br/>
And sure he is an honourable man.<br/>
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,<br/>
But here I am to speak what I do know.<br/>
You all did love him once, not without cause;<br/>
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?<br/>
O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,<br/>
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me.<br/>
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,<br/>
And I must pause till it come back to me.
</p>

<p>FIRST CITIZEN.<br/>
Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
</p>

<p>SECOND CITIZEN.<br/>
If thou consider rightly of the matter,<br/>
Caesar has had great wrong.
</p>

<p>THIRD CITIZEN.<br/>
Has he, masters?<br/>
I fear there will a worse come in his place.
</p>

<p>FOURTH CITIZEN.<br/>
Mark&rsquo;d ye his words? He would not take the crown;<br/>
Therefore &rsquo;tis certain he was not ambitious.
</p>

<p>FIRST CITIZEN.<br/>
If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
</p>

<p>SECOND CITIZEN.<br/>
Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
</p>

<p>THIRD CITIZEN.<br/>
There&rsquo;s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
</p>

<p>FOURTH CITIZEN.<br/>
Now mark him; he begins again to speak.
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
But yesterday the word of Caesar might<br/>
Have stood against the world; now lies he there,<br/>
And none so poor to do him reverence.<br/>
O masters! If I were dispos&rsquo;d to stir<br/>
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,<br/>
I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,<br/>
Who, you all know, are honourable men.<br/>
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose<br/>
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,<br/>
Than I will wrong such honourable men.<br/>
But here&rsquo;s a parchment with the seal of Caesar,<br/>
I found it in his closet; &rsquo;tis his will:<br/>
Let but the commons hear this testament,<br/>
Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read,<br/>
And they would go and kiss dead Caesar&rsquo;s wounds,<br/>
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood;<br/>
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,<br/>
And, dying, mention it within their wills,<br/>
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy<br/>
Unto their issue.
</p>

<p>FOURTH CITIZEN.<br/>
We&rsquo;ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony.
</p>

<p>CITIZENS.<br/>
The will, the will! We will hear Caesar&rsquo;s will.
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it.<br/>
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.<br/>
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;<br/>
And being men, hearing the will of Caesar,<br/>
It will inflame you, it will make you mad.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;<br/>
For if you should, O, what would come of it?
</p>

<p>FOURTH CITIZEN.<br/>
Read the will! We&rsquo;ll hear it, Antony;<br/>
You shall read us the will, Caesar&rsquo;s will!
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?<br/>
I have o&rsquo;ershot myself to tell you of it.<br/>
I fear I wrong the honourable men<br/>
Whose daggers have stabb&rsquo;d Caesar; I do fear it.
</p>

<p>FOURTH CITIZEN.<br/>
They were traitors. Honourable men!
</p>

<p>CITIZENS.<br/>
The will! The testament!
</p>

<p>SECOND CITIZEN.<br/>
They were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will!
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
You will compel me then to read the will?<br/>
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,<br/>
And let me show you him that made the will.<br/>
Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?
</p>

<p>CITIZENS.<br/>
Come down.
</p>

<p>SECOND CITIZEN.<br/>
Descend.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>He comes down.</i>]</p>

<p>THIRD CITIZEN.<br/>
You shall have leave.
</p>

<p>FOURTH CITIZEN.<br/>
A ring! Stand round.
</p>

<p>FIRST CITIZEN.<br/>
Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.
</p>

<p>SECOND CITIZEN.<br/>
Room for Antony, most noble Antony!
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.
</p>

<p>CITIZENS.<br/>
Stand back; room! bear back.
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.<br/>
You all do know this mantle. I remember<br/>
The first time ever Caesar put it on;<br/>
&rsquo;Twas on a Summer&rsquo;s evening, in his tent,<br/>
That day he overcame the Nervii.<br/>
Look, in this place ran Cassius&rsquo; dagger through:<br/>
See what a rent the envious Casca made:<br/>
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb&rsquo;d;<br/>
And as he pluck&rsquo;d his cursed steel away,<br/>
Mark how the blood of Caesar follow&rsquo;d it,<br/>
As rushing out of doors, to be resolv&rsquo;d<br/>
If Brutus so unkindly knock&rsquo;d, or no;<br/>
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar&rsquo;s angel.<br/>
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar lov&rsquo;d him.<br/>
This was the most unkindest cut of all;<br/>
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,<br/>
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors&rsquo; arms,<br/>
Quite vanquish&rsquo;d him: then burst his mighty heart;<br/>
And in his mantle muffling up his face,<br/>
Even at the base of Pompey&rsquo;s statue<br/>
Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.<br/>
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!<br/>
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,<br/>
Whilst bloody treason flourish&rsquo;d over us.<br/>
O, now you weep; and I perceive you feel<br/>
The dint of pity. These are gracious drops.<br/>
Kind souls, what weep you when you but behold<br/>
Our Caesar&rsquo;s vesture wounded? Look you here,<br/>
Here is himself, marr&rsquo;d, as you see, with traitors.
</p>

<p>FIRST CITIZEN.<br/>
O piteous spectacle!
</p>

<p>SECOND CITIZEN.<br/>
O noble Caesar!
</p>

<p>THIRD CITIZEN.<br/>
O woeful day!
</p>

<p>FOURTH CITIZEN.<br/>
O traitors, villains!
</p>

<p>FIRST CITIZEN.<br/>
O most bloody sight!
</p>

<p>SECOND CITIZEN.<br/>
We will be revenged.
</p>

<p>CITIZENS.<br/>
Revenge,&mdash;about,&mdash;seek,&mdash;burn,&mdash;fire,&mdash;kill,&mdash;slay,&mdash;let
not a traitor live!
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
Stay, countrymen.
</p>

<p>FIRST CITIZEN.<br/>
Peace there! Hear the noble Antony.
</p>

<p>SECOND CITIZEN.<br/>
We&rsquo;ll hear him, we&rsquo;ll follow him, we&rsquo;ll die with him.
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up<br/>
To such a sudden flood of mutiny.<br/>
They that have done this deed are honourable.<br/>
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,<br/>
That made them do it. They&rsquo;re wise and honourable,<br/>
And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.<br/>
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.<br/>
I am no orator, as Brutus is;<br/>
But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,<br/>
That love my friend; and that they know full well<br/>
That gave me public leave to speak of him.<br/>
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,<br/>
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,<br/>
To stir men&rsquo;s blood. I only speak right on.<br/>
I tell you that which you yourselves do know,<br/>
Show you sweet Caesar&rsquo;s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,<br/>
And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,<br/>
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony<br/>
Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue<br/>
In every wound of Caesar, that should move<br/>
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
</p>

<p>CITIZENS.<br/>
We&rsquo;ll mutiny.
</p>

<p>FIRST CITIZEN.<br/>
We&rsquo;ll burn the house of Brutus.
</p>

<p>THIRD CITIZEN.<br/>
Away, then! come, seek the conspirators.
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
</p>

<p>CITIZENS.<br/>
Peace, ho! Hear Antony; most noble Antony.
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.<br/>
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?<br/>
Alas, you know not; I must tell you then.<br/>
You have forgot the will I told you of.
</p>

<p>CITIZENS.<br/>
Most true; the will!&mdash;let&rsquo;s stay, and hear the will.
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
Here is the will, and under Caesar&rsquo;s seal.<br/>
To every Roman citizen he gives,<br/>
To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.
</p>

<p>SECOND CITIZEN.<br/>
Most noble Caesar! We&rsquo;ll revenge his death.
</p>

<p>THIRD CITIZEN.<br/>
O, royal Caesar!
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
Hear me with patience.
</p>

<p>CITIZENS.<br/>
Peace, ho!
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,<br/>
His private arbors, and new-planted orchards,<br/>
On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,<br/>
And to your heirs forever; common pleasures,<br/>
To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.<br/>
Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?
</p>

<p>FIRST CITIZEN.<br/>
Never, never. Come, away, away!<br/>
We&rsquo;ll burn his body in the holy place,<br/>
And with the brands fire the traitors&rsquo; houses.<br/>
Take up the body.
</p>

<p>SECOND CITIZEN.<br/>
Go, fetch fire.

Wisely I say I am a bachelor.

The three-fold world divided, he should stand<br/>
One of the three to share it?
</p>

<p>OCTAVIUS.<br/>
So you thought him,<br/>
And took his voice who should be prick&rsquo;d to die<br/>
In our black sentence and proscription.
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
Octavius, I have seen more days than you;<br/>
And though we lay these honours on this man,<br/>
To ease ourselves of divers sland&rsquo;rous loads,<br/>
He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,<br/>
To groan and sweat under the business,<br/>
Either led or driven, as we point the way;<br/>
And having brought our treasure where we will,<br/>
Then take we down his load, and turn him off,<br/>
Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,<br/>
And graze in commons.
</p>

<p>OCTAVIUS.<br/>
You may do your will;<br/>
But he&rsquo;s a tried and valiant soldier.
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
So is my horse, Octavius; and for that<br/>
I do appoint him store of provender.<br/>
It is a creature that I teach to fight,<br/>
To wind, to stop, to run directly on,<br/>
His corporal motion govern&rsquo;d by my spirit.<br/>
And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so:<br/>
He must be taught, and train&rsquo;d, and bid go forth:<br/>
A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds<br/>
On objects, arts, and imitations,<br/>
Which, out of use and stal&rsquo;d by other men,<br/>
Begin his fashion. Do not talk of him<br/>
But as a property. And now, Octavius,<br/>
Listen great things. Brutus and Cassius<br/>
Are levying powers; we must straight make head.<br/>
Therefore let our alliance be combin&rsquo;d,<br/>
Our best friends made, our means stretch&rsquo;d;<br/>
And let us presently go sit in council,<br/>
How covert matters may be best disclos&rsquo;d,<br/>
And open perils surest answered.
</p>

<p>OCTAVIUS.<br/>
Let us do so: for we are at the stake,<br/>
And bay&rsquo;d about with many enemies;<br/>
And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,<br/>
Millions of mischiefs.

With courtesy and with respect enough,<br/>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Thou hast describ&rsquo;d<br/>
A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,<br/>
When love begins to sicken and decay<br/>
It useth an enforced ceremony.<br/>
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;<br/>

Cassius, be content.<br/>
Speak your griefs softly, I do know you well.<br/>
Before the eyes of both our armies here,<br/>
Which should perceive nothing but love from us,<br/>
Let us not wrangle. Bid them move away;<br/>
Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,<br/>
And I will give you audience.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Pindarus,<br/>
Bid our commanders lead their charges off<br/>
A little from this ground.

Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man<br/>
Come to our tent till we have done our conference.<br/>
Lucius and Titinius, guard our door.

<h4><b>SCENE III. Within the tent of Brutus.</b></h4>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Brutus</span> and
<span class="charname">Cassius</span>.</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
That you have wrong&rsquo;d me doth appear in this:<br/>
You have condemn&rsquo;d and noted Lucius Pella<br/>
For taking bribes here of the Sardians;<br/>
Wherein my letters, praying on his side<br/>
Because I knew the man, were slighted off.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
You wrong&rsquo;d yourself to write in such a case.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
In such a time as this it is not meet<br/>
That every nice offence should bear his comment.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself<br/>
Are much condemn&rsquo;d to have an itching palm,<br/>
To sell and mart your offices for gold<br/>
To undeservers.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
I an itching palm!<br/>
You know that you are Brutus that speak this,<br/>
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
The name of Cassius honours this corruption,<br/>
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Chastisement!
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Remember March, the Ides of March remember:<br/>
Did not great Julius bleed for justice&rsquo; sake?<br/>
What villain touch&rsquo;d his body, that did stab,<br/>
And not for justice? What! Shall one of us,<br/>
That struck the foremost man of all this world<br/>
But for supporting robbers, shall we now<br/>
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,<br/>
And sell the mighty space of our large honours<br/>
For so much trash as may be grasped thus?<br/>
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,<br/>
Than such a Roman.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Brutus, bait not me,<br/>
I&rsquo;ll not endure it. You forget yourself,<br/>
To hedge me in. I am a soldier, I,<br/>
Older in practice, abler than yourself<br/>
To make conditions.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Go to; you are not, Cassius.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
I am.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
I say you are not.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;<br/>
Have mind upon your health, tempt me no farther.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Away, slight man!
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Is&rsquo;t possible?
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Hear me, for I will speak.<br/>
Must I give way and room to your rash choler?<br/>
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
O ye gods, ye gods! Must I endure all this?
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
All this? ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;<br/>
Go show your slaves how choleric you are,<br/>
And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?<br/>
Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch<br/>
Under your testy humour? By the gods,<br/>
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,<br/>
Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,<br/>
I&rsquo;ll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,<br/>
When you are waspish.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Is it come to this?
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
You say you are a better soldier:<br/>
Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,<br/>
And it shall please me well. For mine own part,<br/>
I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.<br/>
I said, an elder soldier, not a better:<br/>
Did I say better?
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
If you did, I care not.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
When Caesar liv&rsquo;d, he durst not thus have mov&rsquo;d me.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
I durst not?
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
No.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
What? durst not tempt him?
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
For your life you durst not.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Do not presume too much upon my love.<br/>
I may do that I shall be sorry for.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
You have done that you should be sorry for.<br/>
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,<br/>
For I am arm&rsquo;d so strong in honesty,<br/>
That they pass by me as the idle wind,<br/>
Which I respect not. I did send to you<br/>
For certain sums of gold, which you denied me;<br/>
For I can raise no money by vile means:<br/>
By Heaven, I had rather coin my heart,<br/>
And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring<br/>
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash<br/>
By any indirection. I did send<br/>
To you for gold to pay my legions,<br/>
Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?<br/>
Should I have answer&rsquo;d Caius Cassius so?<br/>
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,<br/>
To lock such rascal counters from his friends,<br/>
Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,<br/>
Dash him to pieces!
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
I denied you not.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
You did.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
I did not. He was but a fool<br/>
That brought my answer back. Brutus hath riv&rsquo;d my heart.<br/>
A friend should bear his friend&rsquo;s infirmities;<br/>
But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
I do not, till you practise them on me.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
You love me not.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
I do not like your faults.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
A friendly eye could never see such faults.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
A flatterer&rsquo;s would not, though they do appear<br/>
As huge as high Olympus.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,<br/>
Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,<br/>
For Cassius is a-weary of the world:<br/>
Hated by one he loves; brav&rsquo;d by his brother;<br/>
Check&rsquo;d like a bondman; all his faults observ&rsquo;d,<br/>
Set in a note-book, learn&rsquo;d and conn&rsquo;d by rote,<br/>
To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep<br/>
My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,<br/>
And here my naked breast; within, a heart<br/>
Dearer than Plutus&rsquo; mine, richer than gold:<br/>
If that thou be&rsquo;st a Roman, take it forth.<br/>
I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:<br/>
Strike as thou didst at Caesar; for I know,<br/>
When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better<br/>
Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Sheathe your dagger.<br/>
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;<br/>
Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.<br/>
O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb<br/>
That carries anger as the flint bears fire,<br/>
Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,<br/>
And straight is cold again.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Hath Cassius liv&rsquo;d<br/>
To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,<br/>
When grief and blood ill-temper&rsquo;d vexeth him?
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
When I spoke that, I was ill-temper&rsquo;d too.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
And my heart too.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
O Brutus!
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
What&rsquo;s the matter?
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Have not you love enough to bear with me,<br/>
When that rash humour which my mother gave me<br/>
Makes me forgetful?
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Yes, Cassius; and from henceforth,<br/>
When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,<br/>
He&rsquo;ll think your mother chides, and leave you so.

Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
With what addition?
</p>

<p>MESSALA.<br/>
That by proscription and bills of outlawry<br/>
Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus<br/>
Have put to death an hundred Senators.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Therein our letters do not well agree.<br/>

Cicero one!

No, Messala.

No, my lord.

Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.<br/>

I have the patience to endure it now.
</p>

<p>MESSALA.<br/>
Even so great men great losses should endure.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
I have as much of this in art as you,<br/>
But yet my nature could not bear it so.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Well, to our work alive. What do you think<br/>
Of marching to Philippi presently?
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
I do not think it good.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Your reason?
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
This it is:<br/>
&rsquo;Tis better that the enemy seek us;<br/>
So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,<br/>
Doing himself offence, whilst we, lying still,<br/>
Are full of rest, defence, and nimbleness.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Good reasons must of force give place to better.<br/>
The people &rsquo;twixt Philippi and this ground<br/>
Do stand but in a forced affection;<br/>
For they have grudg&rsquo;d us contribution.<br/>
The enemy, marching along by them,<br/>
By them shall make a fuller number up,<br/>
Come on refresh&rsquo;d, new-added, and encourag&rsquo;d;<br/>
From which advantage shall we cut him off<br/>
If at Philippi we do face him there,<br/>
These people at our back.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Hear me, good brother.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Under your pardon. You must note besides,<br/>
That we have tried the utmost of our friends,<br/>
Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe.<br/>
The enemy increaseth every day;<br/>
We, at the height, are ready to decline.<br/>
There is a tide in the affairs of men,<br/>
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;<br/>
Omitted, all the voyage of their life<br/>
Is bound in shallows and in miseries.<br/>
On such a full sea are we now afloat,<br/>
And we must take the current when it serves,<br/>
Or lose our ventures.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Then, with your will, go on:<br/>
We&rsquo;ll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
The deep of night is crept upon our talk,<br/>
And nature must obey necessity,<br/>
Which we will niggard with a little rest.<br/>

Answering before we do demand of them.

Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know<br/>
Wherefore they do it. They could be content<br/>

</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
Villains, you did not so when your vile daggers<br/>
Hack&rsquo;d one another in the sides of Caesar:<br/>
You show&rsquo;d your teeth like apes, and fawn&rsquo;d like hounds,<br/>
And bow&rsquo;d like bondmen, kissing Caesar&rsquo;s feet;<br/>
Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind<br/>
Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself.<br/>

Come, come, the cause. If arguing makes us sweat,<br/>
The proof of it will turn to redder drops.<br/>
Look, I draw a sword against conspirators.<br/>

Never, till Caesar&rsquo;s three and thirty wounds<br/>
Be well aveng&rsquo;d; or till another Caesar<br/>
Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors&rsquo; hands,<br/>
Unless thou bring&rsquo;st them with thee.

</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Messala,<br/>
This is my birth-day; as this very day<br/>
Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:<br/>
Be thou my witness that against my will<br/>
As Pompey was, am I compell&rsquo;d to set<br/>
Upon one battle all our liberties.<br/>
You know that I held Epicurus strong,<br/>
And his opinion. Now I change my mind,<br/>
And partly credit things that do presage.<br/>
Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign<br/>
Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch&rsquo;d,<br/>
Gorging and feeding from our soldiers&rsquo; hands,<br/>
Who to Philippi here consorted us.<br/>
This morning are they fled away and gone,<br/>
And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites<br/>
Fly o&rsquo;er our heads, and downward look on us,<br/>
As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem<br/>
A canopy most fatal, under which<br/>
Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.
</p>

<p>MESSALA.<br/>
Believe not so.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
I but believe it partly,<br/>
For I am fresh of spirit, and resolv&rsquo;d<br/>
To meet all perils very constantly.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Even so, Lucilius.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Now, most noble Brutus,<br/>
The gods today stand friendly, that we may,<br/>
Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!<br/>
But, since the affairs of men rest still incertain,<br/>
Let&rsquo;s reason with the worst that may befall.<br/>
If we do lose this battle, then is this<br/>
The very last time we shall speak together:<br/>
What are you then determined to do?
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Even by the rule of that philosophy<br/>
By which I did blame Cato for the death<br/>
Which he did give himself, I know not how,<br/>
But I do find it cowardly and vile,<br/>
For fear of what might fall, so to prevent<br/>
The time of life, arming myself with patience<br/>
To stay the providence of some high powers<br/>
That govern us below.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
Then, if we lose this battle,<br/>
You are contented to be led in triumph<br/>
Thorough the streets of Rome?
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,<br/>
That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;<br/>
He bears too great a mind. But this same day<br/>
Must end that work the Ides of March begun;<br/>
And whether we shall meet again I know not.<br/>
Therefore our everlasting farewell take.<br/>
For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius.<br/>
If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;<br/>
If not, why then this parting was well made.
</p>

<p>CASSIUS.<br/>
For ever and for ever farewell, Brutus.<br/>
If we do meet again, we&rsquo;ll smile indeed;<br/>
If not, &rsquo;tis true this parting was well made.
</p>

<p>BRUTUS.<br/>
Why then, lead on. O, that a man might know<br/>
The end of this day&rsquo;s business ere it come!<br/>
But it sufficeth that the day will end,<br/>
And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!

I kill&rsquo;d not thee with half so good a will.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>He runs on his sword, and dies.</i>]</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Alarum. Retreat. Enter <span class="charname">Antony,
Octavius, Messala, Lucilius</span> and the Army.</p>

<p>OCTAVIUS.<br/>
What man is that?
</p>

<p>MESSALA.<br/>
My master&rsquo;s man. Strato, where is thy master?
</p>

<p>STRATO.<br/>
Free from the bondage you are in, Messala.<br/>
The conquerors can but make a fire of him;<br/>
For Brutus only overcame himself,<br/>
And no man else hath honour by his death.
</p>

<p>LUCILIUS.<br/>
So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,<br/>
That thou hast prov&rsquo;d Lucilius&rsquo; saying true.
</p>

<p>OCTAVIUS.<br/>
All that serv&rsquo;d Brutus, I will entertain them.<br/>
Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?
</p>

<p>STRATO.<br/>
Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
</p>

<p>OCTAVIUS.<br/>
Do so, good Messala.
</p>

<p>MESSALA.<br/>
How died my master, Strato?
</p>

<p>STRATO.<br/>
I held the sword, and he did run on it.
</p>

<p>MESSALA.<br/>
Octavius, then take him to follow thee,<br/>
That did the latest service to my master.
</p>

<p>ANTONY.<br/>
This was the noblest Roman of them all.<br/>
All the conspirators save only he,<br/>
Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;<br/>
He only, in a general honest thought<br/>
And common good to all, made one of them.<br/>
His life was gentle, and the elements<br/>
So mix&rsquo;d in him that Nature might stand up<br/>
And say to all the world, &ldquo;This was a man!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>OCTAVIUS.<br/>
According to his virtue let us use him<br/>
With all respect and rites of burial.<br/>
Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie,<br/>
Most like a soldier, order&rsquo;d honourably.<br/>
So call the field to rest, and let&rsquo;s away,<br/>
To part the glories of this happy day.

a team of about twenty Project Gutenberg volunteers.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
